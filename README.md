Seminar work - spring 2023
* This is showcase of my html and css skills. It does not representate my php, or java script knowledge *
It is seminar work, I did in spring 2023, first only using html and css and downloaded java script lightbox. Creating dedicated css file for every page was not great idea, but for something, that was allready finished and graded, 
it took too much efort to change it. I took inspiration from Praga websites, https://pragaglobal.com/cs/ used their images and texts, but I did all the coding and the design of this website is just hugely inspired. Not copied. :)
Also I later moved from html to php to make it dynamic.
